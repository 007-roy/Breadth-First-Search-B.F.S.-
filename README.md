<p>To undertand Breadth First Search, we basically need to learn some more things. Specially, Linked List and Queue.
A Linked list is a kind of list that actually can be called secured list. One node is connected to the other nodes.
Basically, every nodes are bonded together.And on the hand queue is a type of data structure that called L.I.F.O.
It's called "Last In First Out", because we can add a node/element at the end of the queue. But, we have to delete a
node from the start of the queue.We also need to have knowledge about Adjacency list.</p>
